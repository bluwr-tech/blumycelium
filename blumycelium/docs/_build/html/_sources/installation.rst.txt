Installation
=============

BLUMYCELIUM is not available on pypi yet. We will push it once we think it is stable enough.
For now please install it from github.

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install git+https://github.com/bluwr-tech/blumycelium.git


Not that you will need a working ArangoDB database for it to run. Please have a look a the Quickstart page
for a detailed installation process with the database.
