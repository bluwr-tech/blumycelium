BLUMYCELIUM: Async micro-services, 100% in python from Bluwr
============================================================

**Machine Elf <- Mycelium -> Machine Elf**

BLUMYCELIUM allows you to write complex microservice orchestration all in python. You can divide a complex application into many smaller parts that can be tested independtly and ran asynchronously. These smaller parts are agents called *Machine Elves* and the *Mycelium* is the database they use to communicate.

Myceliums are stored in an ArangoDB instance and can be setup anywhere you'd like:
	- Locally
	- On the cloud
	- Etc...
	

Arms-length microservices means that inside a mycelium we all trust each other, there are no credentials
